Deep in her sanctum beneath Eldoria's streets, Nyla arranges seven crystalline orbs in a perfect circle.
 Each contains a different vision of stone battlements and weathered wallsâ€”possible matches for
 the mysterious fortress the Queen seeks in the southern kingdoms of Chile. The image in her central
 crystal pulses with ancient power, showing a majestic citadel hidden among the distant Chilean mountains.
 Her fingers dance across each comparison crystal, her enchanted sight noting subtle architectural
 differences between the visions. The runes along her sleeves glow more
 intensely with each elimination until only one crystal remains illuminated.
 As she focuses her magical threads on this final vision, precise location runes appear in glowing script
 around the orb. Nyla smiles in satisfaction as the fortress reveals not just its position,
 but its true name and history. A more challenging mystery solved by Eldoria's premier information seeker,
 who knows that even the most distant fortifications cannot hide their secrets
 from one who compares the patterns of stone and shadow.
